# 2024-12-12: Main Chatbot Architecture Update

## Issue
- Found mismatch between old ChatbotCore architecture and new Web Component based architecture
- Manual initialization code conflicting with web component lifecycle
- Reference error: ChatbotCore not defined

## Changes Made
- Removed manual initialization code in favor of web component lifecycle
- Updated MainChatbot class to properly extend BaseChatbot
- Moved user ID management into connectedCallback
- Properly registered web component using customElements.define

## Learnings
- Web components should handle their own initialization through lifecycle methods
- Need to fully commit to either manual initialization or web component architecture, mixing both causes conflicts
- Importance of maintaining consistent architecture throughout the codebase

## Next Steps
- Test the new initialization flow
- Verify history loading works correctly
- Ensure proper event handling between components

# 2024-12-12: SSE Connection Handling Improvements

## Issue
- AbortError occurring during SSE connections but traces still coming through
- Unhandled trace types (flow, block, debug)
- Poor cleanup of previous SSE connections

## Changes Made
- Added delay after aborting previous connections for proper cleanup
- Added proper Accept header for SSE connections
- Implemented handling for different trace types
- Added better error handling for AbortError cases
- Added debug logging for trace processing

## Learnings
- SSE connections need proper cleanup before new ones are established
- Voiceflow sends various trace types that need handling
- AbortController needs careful management to prevent race conditions

## Next Steps
- Monitor SSE connection stability
- Add more sophisticated trace type handling
- Consider implementing reconnection logic for failed connections

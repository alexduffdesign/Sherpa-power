## Issue: Chatbot Launch and Trace Handling

### Initial Problems:
1. AbortError when launching chatbot
2. Unhandled trace types from Voiceflow API

### Investigation:
1. First fixed endpoint handling in base-chatbot.js:
   - Removed attribute-based endpoint
   - Now using constant GADGET_API_ENDPOINT directly
   - This partially fixed the launch issue

2. Discovered unhandled trace types:
   - flow: Voiceflow's flow control events
   - block: Dialog block execution events
   - debug: Debug information from Voiceflow
   - These traces don't require UI updates, but were causing console warnings

### Solutions Implemented:
1. Simplified endpoint handling:
   - Removed getAttribute("endpoint") logic
   - Using single GADGET_API_ENDPOINT constant
   - Removed unnecessary error checks

2. Added trace type handlers:
   - Added cases for flow, block, and debug traces
   - These traces are now silently handled
   - Keeps console clean of warnings
   - No UI updates needed for these trace types

### Lessons Learned:
1. Voiceflow sends more trace types than just UI-related ones
2. Some traces are for flow control and debugging - they don't need UI updates
3. Simpler endpoint handling is more reliable

### Next Steps:
1. Monitor for any other unhandled trace types
2. Consider adding debug mode to log flow/block/debug traces when needed
3. Test conversation flow thoroughly to ensure no messages are missed
